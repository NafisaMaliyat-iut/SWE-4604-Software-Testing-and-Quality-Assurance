define a unit - class, package, function, bundles of functions.... you geddit
usually, packages are too large so are not considered as unit. and function is a unit if it is independent
from other modules. 
you give different kinds of input and expect the correct output. you don't know what is actually going on 
inside the unit (black box testing)>.
